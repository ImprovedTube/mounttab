I want a program that can mount the tabs I have open as a file system. Be able to save and relauch sessions. Inspired by https://omar.website/tabfs/

It should mount the browser files in the current working directory. 



## Questions
- How do I distinguish between multiple browser sessions? 
    - You have to select the session from the browser.


## Goals

- Eventually I want to do this with tmux sessions and pdfs. I want a way to save my full OS session and store in a working directory. 

Everything shoudl be a file
